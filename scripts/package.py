"""Create a python package for the current repository, as if by calling `python -m build`.

Additional work performed by this script consists of determining the binady distribution's listed version. The rules are
are described below.

Assuming the version listed in `pyproject.toml` is `1.2.3`:
1. If the current git commit is tagged `v1.2.3`, the distribution is tagged `v1.2.3`.
2. Otherwise, if a git tag `v1.2.3` does not exist, the distribution is tagged `v1.2.3a0.dev+{short git hash}` (an
   alpha development pre-release).
3. Otherwise, if that tag exists and points to an ancestor of the current commit, the distribution is tagged
   `v1.2.3r0.dev+{short git hash}` (a development post-release).
4. Otherwise, if that tag exists and points to an unrelated commit, the script aborts with an error.

Assuming the version in `pyproject.toml` follows semantic versioning rules (core version only, no suffixes like
`-alpha`), the script will always produce a distribution with a version specifier compliant with PYPA's guidelines.

See PYPA guidelines for versions: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/
