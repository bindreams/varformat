"""Create a python package for the current repository, as if by calling `python -m build`.

Additional work performed by this script consists of determining the binary distribution's listed version. The rules are
described below.

Assuming the version listed in `pyproject.toml` is `1.2.3`:
1. If git HEAD is tagged `v1.2.3`, the distribution is tagged `v1.2.3`.
2. Otherwise, if a git tag `v1.2.3` points to a commit either that is either a child or a parent of HEAD, or does not
   exist at all, the distribution is tagged `v1.2.3.dev0+{short git hash}` (a development release).
3. Otherwise, if that tag exists and points to an unrelated commit, the script aborts with an error.

Assuming the version in `pyproject.toml` follows semantic versioning rules (core version only, no suffixes like
`-alpha`), the script will always produce a distribution with a version specifier compliant with PYPA's guidelines.

See PYPA guidelines for versions: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/
See semantic version specifiers: https://semver.org/
